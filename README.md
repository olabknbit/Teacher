# Ola the Teacher

Ola the Teacher is an app that helps you study: you take a photo of your notes with an Android app, the photo is sent to a server that converts it to an mp3 file and sends it back to you device. Now you can listed to all your notes wherever you are.
Code in this repo is an Android client made as a part of a project for a Facebook Warsaw Hackathon 2019. The server is located at: // TODO olagacek.
